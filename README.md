### Hi there 👋

I'm a Business Analyst from Netcacter Technology. I'm very interested in the digital transformation of Enterprise and Cloud solutions.

🔭 I’m currently working on Cloud DevOps Toolset specification and doсumenting our internal processes.

🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of new tools and technologies for me: Jenkins, K8s, Git and S3 storages. Also, I suppose that Java will be quite useful for improving my skills.

💬 Ask me about any questions about Business and System Analysis. I will try to help. If I can’t, we’ll look for answers together.

⚡ Fun fact: My passions are snowboarding, cycling, traveling and lokking for new challeges!
